An usually awesome brainfuck IDE.

### Compiling
To compile you need Ncurses, which you probably already have installed. [(if you don't)](http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/).  
Whatever suits you:
```
# apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev
# yum install ncurses-devel
# pacman -S ncurses
```
