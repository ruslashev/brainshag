An unusually awesome brainfuck IDE.

### Compiling
To compile you need Ncurses, which you probably already have installed. If you don't, [you can get it yourself](http://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/ncurses/), or choose whatever suits you:
```
# apt-get install libncurses5 libncurses5-dev
# yum install ncurses-devel
# pacman -S ncurses
```
